EVTDESC190004;Initially appearing in the Russian periodical Russkiy Vestnik, War and Peace has finally been published in $YEAR$, 2 years after its final serialized debut. Initially titled "1805" by the author Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace chronicles the history of the French Invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic Era as seen through the accounts of five aristocratic families. The author has said that War and Peace "is not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle". Large sections, especially the later chapters, are a philosophical discussion rather than narrative. The first publications sold out overnight, readers of the serialized edition coming in droves to purchase it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC190006;El Gaucho Martin Fierro, a 2,316-line long epic poem by writer José Hernández, has been finished. Together with the second installment, La Vuelta de Martin Fierro (The Return of Martin Fierro), the poem tells the story of the eponymous protagonist, an impoverished gaucho, who was drafted to serve at a border fort against the native population. His romanticized life on the pampas tells his adventures ranging from deserting in an attempt to go home only to find everything he loved gone, deliberately provoking an affair of honor by insulting a black woman in a bar killing her male companion on the ensuing knife duel, becoming an outlaw and other many tales.

EVTDESC66100;In $YEAR$, the Milanese launched an anti-Austrian campaign as early as 1 January. On New Years Day the Milanese started to boycott gambling and tobacco products, which were government monopolies that brought in over 5 million lire a year. The boycott culminated in a bloody street battle on 3 January, when Austrian soldiers, in batches of three, were being insulted and pelted with stones by an angry crowd. The soldiers then gathered together in groups of a dozen and charged the crowd with swords and bayonets, killing five and wounding another 59. Radetzky confined his troops to barracks for five days. The protests were over, but two months later, when news reached Milan of the uprising in Vienna and the fall of Metternich, the Milanese took to the streets again, on 18 March.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC66101;Across Italy, discomfort with foreign domination and with absolute monarchy had led to all Italian states (apart from Lombardy-Venetia) becoming parliamentary monarchies with much of the reform led by Pope Pius IX. Heavy-handed policing in response to an economic boycott of state monopolies in Austrian-held Milan led to the popular expulsion of the Austrian garrison in the city for five days in $YEAR$.
